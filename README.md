# üìå Overview
Deploy the OpenShift OKD 3.11 platform and integrate the deployment of a sample application using a microservices architecture (Simple_Microservice_QuizApp) to validate the platform's capability and stability for application deployment

# üìù Introduction
OpenShift OKD 3.11 is the open-source (community edition) version of Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform, built on Kubernetes and developed by the community
With OKD, user can experience OpenShift for free, making it suitable for development, testing, research environments or small businesses that do not require commercial support from Red Hat
